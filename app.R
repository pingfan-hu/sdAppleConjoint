# Database setup

# surveydown stores data on a database that you define at https://supabase.com/
# To connect to a database, update the sd_database() function with details
# from your supabase database. For this demo, we set ignore = TRUE, which will
# ignore the settings and won't attempt to connect to the database. This is
# helpful for local testing if you don't want to record testing data in the
# database table. See the documentation for details:
# https://surveydown.org/store-data
